# Scrum Team

This is the fundamental unit of Scrum.  This is a small group of individuals that consists of three core roles.

  - [Developers](#developers)
  - [Product Owner](#product-owner)
  - [Scrum Master](#scrum-master)

There are no hierarchies, but rather a united, cross-functional team with all the skills needed to get the job done and deliver the [Product Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-goal).

Scrum teams stay small, small enough to be nimble but large enough to be able to deliver a valuable goals every iteration ([Sprint](Scrum%20Events#the-sprint)).  The team should be kept small to allow more effective communication and collaboration.

As the Scrum Team have responsibility to deliver Goals within iterations ([Sprints](Scrum%20Events#the-sprint)), this will include all tasks and duties require to deliver a usable [Product Increment](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-increment).  This can be challenging, at times, with increased deadlines and commitment from the Scrum Team.  A major tenet of Scrum is delivering to a sustainable pace, meaning that the Scrum Team can perform its delivery commitments indefinitely.  

## Developers

These are the people in the Scrum Team that create the usable product increment at the end of each iteration ([Sprint](Scrum%20Events#the-sprint)).  It is expected that they contain all the skills needed to achieve this.  The term "Developers" is unlikely to encompass only software engineers, but also anyone else committed and engaged in building the Product (e.g.; Marketing, Designers, etc.).

They are accountable for:

* Creating a plan for the iteration ([Sprint](Scrum%20Events#the-sprint)), called the [Sprint Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-backlog)
* Ensuring that iteration ([Sprint](Scrum%20Events#the-sprint)) deliverables meet the team's [Definition of Done](Scrum%20Artifacts#definition-of-done) (DoD)
* Inspecting and adapting the plan to ensure that the team remain aligned to the [Sprint Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-goal)
* Ensuring that all the team honour the commitment to quality and delivering the product

## Product Owner

The Product Owner is often the most challenging role in the Scrum Team.  They are accountable for maximising the value of the work delivered by the team.  They are also accountable for the management of the [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog), including;

* Definine and sharing the [Product Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-goal)
* Clearly expressing each [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) Item (PBI)
* Prioritising (or ordering) the [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) to maximise value
* Ensuring that the [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) is clearly understandable, is shared and transparent

This requires the Product Owner to effectively lead the Product(s) within an organisation. The Product Owner must also engage and represent all stakeholder in the Product.  This is a significant level of accountability. 

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master, as the role title suggests, is the master of the Scrum, the expert.  They ensure that the Scrum Team adhere to the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/) and strive to be a high functioning team.  They have no formal responsibility over the Scrum Team, they do not manage them, they serve them.  Rather, they coach the team to be a better Scrum Team.  This accountability extends to coaching the wider organisation in the adoption, use and value of Scrum.

* Ensuring that the Scrum Team are sharing and resolving impediments in their path
