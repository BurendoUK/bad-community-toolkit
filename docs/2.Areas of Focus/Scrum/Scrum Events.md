# Scrum Events

Scrum Events provide the backbone for the Scrum Framework.  They are the meetings needed to allow [Scrum Teams](Scrum%20Team) to collaborate and plan together.

## The Sprint

Scrum is iterative, in that it is repeatable.  Each iteration is a time-box, call as Sprint.  The Sprint is core to Scrum and where [Product Increments](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-increment) are created to achieve the [Sprint Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-goal)

Sprints are time-boxed / fixed length, each no more than one month.  Typical Sprint lengths range from 1 to 3 weeks.  Each Sprint immediately proceeds at the end of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to deliver the Product Goal, including; Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- All delivered [Sprint Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-backlog) MUST meet the agreed [Definition of Done](Scrum%20Artifacts#definition-of-done) 
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed, in preparation for future Sprints
- [Sprint Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-backlog) items may be clarified and renegotiated with the [Product Owner](Scrum%20Team#product-owner) as more is learned

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a [Product Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-goal).

[Scrum Teams](Scrum%20Team) may use a number of approaches to help provide visibility and forecast deliverables, such as;

- [Cumulative Flow](/docs/Tools/Cumulative%20Flow) reports
- [Burndown](/docs/Tools/Burndown%20Charts) or [Burnup](/docs/Tools/Burnup%20Charts) charts
- [Control Charts](/docs/Tools/Control%20Charts) / [Cycle Time](/docs/Tools/Cycle%20Time%20Reports) reports

Though, it should be noted, that these will not replace empirical evidence

## Sprint Planning

The Sprint Planning event initiates the Sprint by building the [Sprint Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-backlog) and defining the [Sprint Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-goal).  The event is attended by the entire [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team).


Candidate [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) Items (or PBIs) are made ready (typically to a [Definition of Ready](/docs/todo)) as well as how they align to the [Product Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-goal).  Additional attendees may be invited, if required by the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) in order to provide guidance and advice.

It is the [Product Owner's](Scrum%20Team#product-owner) responsibility to ensure that the attendees are prepared.

Sprint Planning focuses on three core areas:

- How is the Sprint valuable - this should directly relate to the [Sprint Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-goal)
- What can be delivered within the Sprint - the team may use empirical data, such as previous Sprint performances and tools such as [Velocity Charts](/docs/todo) and [Planning Poker](/docs/todo), etc.
- How items get done - This might include decomposing items into tasks or identifying where specialist skills are needed

The [Sprint Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-goal), the [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the [Sprint Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-backlog).

## Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum (sometimes called the Daily Stand-Up) is used for the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) to review progress and revise the [Sprint Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#sprint-backlog) as required.  It is a planning event, not an update, where team members work together to plan the day.

Typically time-boxed to no more than 15 minutes, this event focuses on the [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers).  There may be other attendees, but this event is for the [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers) to plan.

The format of the Daily Scrum is flexible based on the needs of the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team).  Common formats include:

- **Three Questions** - Each person in turn answers three questions; what did you do yesterday, what do you plan to do today and if you have any impediments
- **Walk the Board** - Though not prescribed in the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/), most teams will have a [Sprint Board](/docs/todo) and may use the board to walk through each item in the Sprint with the [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers).

The Daily Scrum is not the only time [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers) plan. They will often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions and planning.

## Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is an opportunity to reflect on what was achieve during the [Sprint](#the-sprint).  It occurs at the end of a [Sprint](#the-sprint).  The [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) presents to stakeholders the outcome of the [Sprint](#the-sprint) and progress towards the [Product Goal](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-goal) is reviewed.

It is an opportunity to reflect on what was and was not achieved and how future [Sprints](#the-sprint) might be shaped and the [Product Backlog](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) tuned to meet the outcomes required.

## Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective (or Retro) is performed after the [Sprint Review](#sprint-review) and effectively closes the Sprint.

It's purpose is to help the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) to continuously improve their performance based on empirical data.

The Retro can be wide-ranging covering multiple areas:

- Individuals
- Collaboration
- Processes
- Tools
- [Definition of Ready](/docs/todo)
- [Definition of Done](Scrum%20Artifacts#definition-of-done)
- Systemic impediments
- Emerging dependencies

The outcome from the Retro is a set of clear and deliverable actions that may be added to a future [Sprint](Scrum%20Artifacts#the-sprint).

The Sprint Retrospective closes the Sprint.
