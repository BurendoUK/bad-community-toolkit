# Scrum Artifacts

Scrum Artifacts are tangible assets that are used to ensure that the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team.md) is focused on delivering valuable and business aligned outcomes.  They help to support transparency.

Each Artifact allow commitments to be measured and ensures transparency:

* The [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) can be measured against the Product Goal
* The [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog) can be measured against the Sprint Goal
* The [Product Increment](#product-increment) can be measured against the Definition of Done (DoD)

## Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered (prioritised) list of what is needed to deliver the desired Product.  It is emergent, in that Product Backlog Items (PBIs) can be added, deleted or changed as needed

PBIs that meet a [Definition of Ready](../../todo) (DoR) are used as candidates for [Sprint Planning](Scrum%20Events.md/#sprint-planning).  PBIs are evolved to meet the DoR via a process of refinement (Product Backlog Refinement).

Typical [Definitions of Ready](../../todo) will have elements such as:

- Can the PBI be delivered within an increment (Sprint)
- Does the PBI have clear acceptance criteria
- Is the PBI clear
- Can we quantify the value of the PBI

Sizing of PBI must only be performed by the [Developers](Scrum%20Team/#developer).  The [Product Owner](Scrum%20Team/#product-owner)

The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

### Product Goal

The Product Goal is a measurable objective that supports your Product Vision.  It serves as a target outcome for the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) to focus on.  The [Product Backlog's](Scrum%20Artifacts#product-backlog) evolves to fulfil the Product Goal.

The Product Goal spans multiple iterations (Sprints).

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a selection of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to be delivered within the next iteration (Sprint).  They are the what and how of the iteration (Sprint).  Married with the Sprint Goal (providing the why), this gives the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) the tools they need to deliver the iteration (Sprint)

The Sprint Backlog is defined by the [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers) as part of [Sprint Planning](Scrum%20Events#sprint-planning), in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.  The Sprint Backlog presents a real-time view of the the deliverables within the iteration (Sprint).

### Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal defines the objective of the iteration (Sprint).  It forms a commitment by the [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers), providing flexibility, as needed to ensure the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) achieve it.  It creates focus and a tangible outcome for the iteration (Sprint).

The Sprint Goal is created at [Sprint Planning](Scrum%20Events#sprint-planning), in collaboration between the [Developers](Scrum%20Team#developers) and the [Product Owner](Scrum%20Team#product-owner).  It forms the "north star" for the iteration (Sprint) and allows for negotiation.

## Product Increment

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

### Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is set of conditions that allow the [Scrum Team](Scrum%20Team) to ensure that Sprint Backlog Items are delivered to an acceptable measure of completion during an iteration (Sprint).  By all Scrum Backlog Items meeting the DoD, a [Product Increment](#prioduct-increment) is created.

A DoD creates a consistent and visible measure what can be accepted as completed.  If a Sprint Backlog Item does not meet the DoD, then is cannot be classed as completed or presented at the [Sprint Review](Scrum%20Events#sprint-review).  At the end of the iteration (Sprint), it is returned to the Product Backlog for a future iteration (Sprint).

[Developers](Scrum%20Team#developer) are required to conform to the Definition of Done.

Example elements of a DoD can contain:

- The item has met all Acceptance Criteria
- The item has been presented to, accepted and approved by the [Product Owner](Scrum%20Team#product-owner)
- The item meets all required constraints (e.g.; Non-Functional Requirements)
- The item meets all quality standards (e.g.; test automation coverage and compliance)
- The item meets all technical standard (e.g.; coding standards, peer review, etc.)
